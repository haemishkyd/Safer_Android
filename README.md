# SAfer Agent
This is an android application linked to a project call **SAfer**.

This is an emergency response application based on finding the closest security company responder based on their having this same app open. 
This is (obviously) an Uber type model.

The server for this (since it needs a server side implementation) is in this [project](https://github.com/haemishkyd/Safer_Server).
